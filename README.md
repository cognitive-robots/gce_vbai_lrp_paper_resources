# Generating Causal Explanations of Vehicular Agent Behavioural Interactions with Learnt Reward Profiles
The data, code, parameters, and videos here relate to a causal explanation generation approach utilising learnt reward profiles and the experiments evaluating it. Specifically, the framework generates explanations for agents within the autonomous driving domain.

## Code
The code for the framework as well as any utility scripts.

## Data
Data and parameters relating to the experiments carried out upon the framework. Note that the experiments referred to here rely upon the High-D dataset which is free for non-commercial use by application at the following link: https://www.highd-dataset.com/. However, as the dataset is not public, only the output experiment data is available in this repository.

## Videos
Contains the summary video for the paper as a whole, as well as qualitative experiment videos depicting the scenarios discussed in the paper.

# Paper
Corresponding conference paper is currently under consideration for IEEE ICRA 2025.
